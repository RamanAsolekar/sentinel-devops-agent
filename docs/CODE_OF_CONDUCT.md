## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

**How to Report:**
1. Contact maintainers directly via email or GitHub
2. Provide detailed information about the incident
3. Include any relevant documentation (screenshots, messages, etc.)
4. Maintain confidentiality during the investigation

All project maintainers are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter of any incident.
