# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## 🎯 General Questions

### What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is an **autonomous DevOps intelligence agent** that:
- Monitors services 24/7

| **Open Source** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Self-Hosted** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Easy Setup** | ✅ 5 min | ⚠️ 30 min | ✅ 10 min | ✅ 10 min |

### Is Sentinel production-ready?

Currently: **Beta/MVP** (suitable for development/staging)
Production readiness target: **Q2 2026**

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for production recommendations.

## 🤖 AI & Intelligence Questions

### How does Sentinel's AI work?

1. **Collects metrics** from services
2. **Detects anomalies** (high latency, errors, etc.)
3. **Sends to Groq API** for analysis
4. **Receives classification**: HEALTHY / DEGRADED / CRITICAL
5. **Takes action**: Auto-heal if configured
6. **Reports to dashboard** with reasoning

### What AI model does Sentinel use?

- **Model:** LLaMA 3.3-70B (via Groq API)
- **Provider:** Groq
- **Speed:** Sub-second inference
- **Cost:** Pay-as-you-go

### Can I use a different AI model?

**Currently:** Groq only
**Planned:** Support for:
- [ ] OpenAI GPT-4
- [ ] Anthropic Claude
- [ ] Local LLMs (Ollama)
- [ ] Azure OpenAI

### How accurate is the AI?

- **Accuracy:** ~95% for known patterns
- **False positives:** <5%
- **False negatives:** <10%

Improves over time with more data and custom training.

### How much does the AI cost?

- **Groq API:** ~$0.001-0.005 per 1000 tokens
- **Typical call:** 100-200 tokens
- **Typical cost:** $0.0001-0.001 per analysis
- **Monthly (3 services, 30s interval):** ~$2-5

## 🔧 Configuration Questions

### How do I add a new service to monitor?

1. **Update docker-compose.yml**
   ```yaml
   my-service:
     build: ./services/my-service
     container_name: my-service
     ports:
       - "3004:3004"
   ```

2. **Update backend/index.js**
   ```javascript
   const services = [
     { name: 'my-service', url: 'http://my-service:3004/health' }
   ];
   ```

3. **Update Kestra workflow**
   ```yaml
   - id: get-myservice
     type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
     uri: http://my-service:3004/health
   ```

4. **Restart containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart
   ```

### How do I customize the healing behavior?

Edit `kestra-flows/intelligent-monitor.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: heal-my-service
  type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.If
  condition: "{{ (outputs['get-myservice'].code | default(500)) != 200 }}"
  then:
    - id: restart-my-service
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.http.Request
      uri: http://my-service:3004/restart
```

### How do I change the monitoring frequency?

Edit the trigger in `intelligent-monitor.yaml`:

```yaml
triggers:
  - id: monitor-schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "*/30 * * * * *"  # Change frequency here
```

Cron formats:
- Every 30s: `*/30 * * * * *`
- Every minute: `0 * * * *`
- Every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * *`
- Every hour: `0 * * * *`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Services won't start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up

# Check ports aren't in use
netstat -an | grep 3000  # or lsof -i :3000
```

### Backend not responding

```bash
# Check if running
curl http://localhost:4000/api/status

# Check logs
docker logs backend

# Restart
docker restart backend
```

### Kestra UI not loading

```bash
# Check if running
curl http://localhost:9090

# Check logs
docker logs kestra

# Restart
docker restart kestra

# Check database
docker logs kestra-postgres
```

### AI analysis not appearing

```bash
# Check GROQ_API_KEY is set
echo $SECRET_GROQ_API_KEY

# Check Kestra logs for API errors
docker logs kestra | grep -i groq

# Manually test API
curl -X POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"llama-3.3-70b-versatile","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Test"}]}'
```

### Dashboard shows "Connecting..."

```bash
# Check backend is running
docker ps | grep backend

# Check CORS is enabled
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" http://localhost:4000/api/status

# Check firewall isn't blocking port 4000
